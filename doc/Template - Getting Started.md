## Why {this tool}?

This tool is really awesome and serves this purpose.

---

## Installation steps {from command line}

### Steps for {this Operating system}

This tool requires this dependency to be installed first: [Some dependency](Link to info).

We can install that using this command:

```
SOME BASH COMMAND TO INSTALL THE DEPENDENCY
```

Now that we have that dependency, we can install {this tool}.
We'll need to run this command:

```
SOME BASH COMMAND
```

Run this command and see if it installed correctly. If it did you should see {such and such output -- screenshot might be nice here}.

```
SOME BASH COMMAND TO TEST IF IT INSTALLED
```

If you did not get {such and such} response you may need to {do this other thing}.

## Quick tutorial

{This tool} is based on these concepts.
We can run the simplest form of this analysis by using this example data that we obtained from {where the data are from and a description about what they are}.

```
A COMMAND TO GET EXAMPLE DATA
```

You can call this example {script/notebook} to run this example analysis.

```
SOME COMMAND THAT RUNS A SIMPLE ANALYSIS
```

Look at this really cool output result! You can get this for your own data too!
