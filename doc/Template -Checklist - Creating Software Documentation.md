## The Why

- [ ] The “why” of this Tool/App is obvious on the main page

- [ ] Summary of Tool/App purpose brief
- [ ] Avoid jargon
- [ ] Example of a good ones 
			- Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a computational method that determines whether and a priori-defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological states (e.g. phenotypes).
			- Salmon is a tool for wicked-fast transcript quantification from RNA-seq data. It requires a set of target transcripts (either from a reference or de-novo assembly) to quantify.
