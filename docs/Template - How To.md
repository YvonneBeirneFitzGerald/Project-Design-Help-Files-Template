- Is easy to find: clearly visible on the main page
- Demonstrates examples that are the most common use case(s)
- Prerequisite knowledge needed is described
  - Links to helpful background knowledge resources are included
- Paste-able or directly runnable code is given and can be run as-is
- Demonstrates a _reproducible_ example
  - An example dataset needed is provided and introduced
  - No additional packages & software is required beyond what is listed on the [Getting Started](Template - Getting Started.md) Page
- Demonstrates step-by-step the most common users for your Project
- Example code write with teaching in mind
- Shows what additional analysis might look like
- Create examples like one would recipes in a cookbook
- Used to show off best use cases for your tool
- Contains examples of what is most useful to the end user
- Create the most needed examples first

##### Every Step Defined
- Every step of the process should be given, don't overlook the basic
- Give the exact code needed especially for command-line tools
- Screenshot or video tutorial when the Project is a GUI

##### Share The Data
- If data is needed to run the example, provide it
- If the data needs to be in a certain format make sure this format is listed and defined 
   - Add a converting tool whenever possible

##### Example Code Goal Illustrates How To Use The Project

- Example Code is written to prioritize clarity over brevity
- Should have comments
- Don't assume end-users understand conventions explain/define them
- Should model best practices
- Be consistence with Coding Style and Conventions
- Try to limit needing other packages and dependencies
	- In a package is required, evaluate if it should automatically install
- Review document at the level of a beginner
- Getting Started is for new users
- How To Sections are geared toward intermediate user who want to know more
- Can move someone from moderate interest to raving fan
- Create examples like one would recipes in a cookbook
- Used to show off best use cases for the Project
