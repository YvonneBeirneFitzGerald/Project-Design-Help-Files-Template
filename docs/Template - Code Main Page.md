### Week 4 - 1 Creating clarifying code comments
###### Learning Objectives Both Sections
- Creating clarifying code comments
		- how well-documented code is a part of a tool with high usability
- Obtaining user feedback
		- how to obtain user feedback to enhance the usability of your tool.

#### The goal of Code Documentation
- Code comments are part of writing good and readable code
- helps your collaborators and future you
	- your understanding of code will fade soon after you write it
- Enduser typically does not look at code directly when they do
	- Troubleshooting and not able to find answers elsewhere 
	- Are power users and very invested in your tool, and might become helpful contributors
	- They might help you maintain it

####  "Rules" Characteristics of Clarifying Code Comments
- Spertus (n.d.) [Best practices for writing code comments - Stack Overflow Blog](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/07/05/best-practices-for-writing-code-comments/)
	1. Comments should not duplicate the code.
	2. Good comments do not excuse unclear code.
	3. If you can’t write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code.
	4. Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it.
	5. Explain unidiomatic code in comments.
	6. Provide links to the original source of copied code.
	7. Include links to external references where they will be most helpful.
	8. Add comments when fixing bugs.
	9. Use comments to mark incomplete implementations.


#### Week 4-1  Exercise: Evaluate your own code’s comments
- Take a look through some of your tool’s code and its comments.
-  Are there places it could be clearer? 
- Take some time to think about your coding process and how it could improve. 
- [Code review](https://simpleprogrammer.com/why-code-reviews-make-better-code-teams/) is also an excellent way to improve code clarity and quality ([Bodner 2018](https://jhudatascience.org/Documentation_and_Usability/no_toc/creating-clarifying-code-comments.html#ref-Bodner2018))!
