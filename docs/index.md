<h1 align="center">Project User Documenation Template</h1>

---
This page is the first page for your end-users.  It is similar to a landing page.  Use it to provide information on what your Project does Why it is an awesome project, and links to help documentation such as [Getting Started](Template - Getting Started.md), [How To](Template - How To.md), and [Reference Guide](Template - Reference Guide.md) Pages.

This document is a template git repo that will allow for customization for your own Project End User Documentation.  This concept is influenced/inspired by [The Documentation and Usability course](https://jhudatascience.org/Documentation_and_Usability/), which is a part of [The Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) Education Resource training series](https://www.itcrtraining.org/courses).
