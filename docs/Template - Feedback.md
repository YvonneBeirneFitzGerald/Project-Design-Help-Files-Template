####  Usability Testing Interview
- Get feedback by asking
- Do before launch or release of major version changes
- Good Resources:
	- [Usability Testing: How to Do It & Its Benefits for Business](https://uxstudioteam.com/ux-blog/usability-testing/)

###### What to use usability testing for:
- Identifying main issues with usability
- Checking if users understand the steps for a task 
- Determine if the navigation works for the user
- Observing how easily and quickly tasks can be preformed
- Do potential end users understand the value proposition of the Project


##### Steps For Conducting Usability Research
Summarized from [Usability Testing: How to Do It & Its Benefits for Business](https://uxstudioteam.com/ux-blog/usability-testing/)

###### Step 1 — Plan out your study
- Define what you want to learn 
- Define a plan and create a script
- What are the key questions you have about Project
- Limit to 1 or 2 key questions
- What task(s) could the end-user perform that would help answer the key questions
- Write a script to use during testing
- Good Resources:
	- [Steve Krug’s usability testing script template](http://sensible.com/downloads/test-script-web.pdf)
	- [GitLab’s advice about usability testing script](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/writing-usability-testing-script/)
	- [GitLab’s usability testing template script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_5Qu2JR9QE5LE6cK4eq9yJs-nXv2rlWWifcjacaiWdI/edit).
- Pilot your test with Team/Friends/Colleagues.

###### Step 2 — Prepare For The Testing Session
- [Useful Checklist](http://sensible.com/downloads/checklists.pdf) 
- [Useful Prompts](https://sensible.com/downloads/things-a-therapist-would-say.pdf) 

######  Step 3 — Find user participants
- Set up a feedback form
- Word of mouth — ask around
- Advertising on Twitter, LinkedIn, or some other social media platform
- [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) helpful tool for scheduling usability testing sessions

###### Step 4 — Run the test!
- After all, the prep is done, and users are scheduled
- Ask if they are ok with the session being recorded (if you would like that)
- Never forget the point from Csontos: 
	- 'Assure your participant that they shoulder no blame. Never let the participants helping you with their valuable feedback feel frustrated'.  
	
###### Step 4 - Analyze & Report
- Review your notes and recordings to look for patterns and insights
