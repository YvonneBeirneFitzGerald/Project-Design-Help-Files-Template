### Week 4 - 2 Obtaining User Feedback
#### User Feedback Goals
- Helps too know code is working
- Get Feedback by asking


#### Basic Feedback Requirements
- A way to alert you if something is wrong with Tool/App
- Make sure you or team responds to notifications

#### Contact Method Ways
- Always ask if uses want to connect with you to do testingof provide feedback
- Have a link to a form for users to submit ([Google forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) are free).  
- Direct users to file a [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues).  
- Have a separate email inbox that you have a notification set up for.

#### Interviews and Usability Testing
- [This excellent article - Usability Testing: How to Do It & Its Benefits for Business](https://uxstudioteam.com/ux-blog/usability-testing/) by Csontos ([2019](https://jhudatascience.org/Documentation_and_Usability/no_toc/obtaining-user-feedback.html#ref-Csontos2019)) takes us through how to conduct usability testing, which we will echo the main points here.

###### What to use usability testing for:
- Identifying main issues in the usability of a product
- Checking if users understand the steps to carry out a task and the navigation
- Observing how easily and quickly they accomplish tasks
- Validating the value proposition of an app or website – do your potential customers understand it?

###### Steps For Conducting Usability Research
- Summarized from Csontos ([2019](https://jhudatascience.org/Documentation_and_Usability/no_toc/obtaining-user-feedback.html#ref-Csontos2019)) steps for conducting usability research:

###### Step 1 - Plan out your study
- Define what you want to learn 
- Define a plan and create a script
- What are the key questions you have about Tool/App
	- Limit to 1 or 2 key questions
- What task(s) could the end-user perform that would help answer the key questions
- Write a script to use during testing
	- Additional information on writing testing scripts

		- [Gitlab’s advice about usability testing script](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/writing-usability-testing-script/) from GitLab 
		- [Gitlab’s usability testing template script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_5Qu2JR9QE5LE6cK4eq9yJs-nXv2rlWWifcjacaiWdI/edit).
- Pilot your test with Team/Friends/Colleagues

###### Step 2 - Prepare for the testing session
- Good check List [Use this checklist](http://sensible.com/downloads/checklists.pdf) from Krug 2010 
- Good -  [these prompts](https://sensible.com/downloads/things-a-therapist-would-say.pdf) from Krug 2010 to help you know what to say to help create a non-judgmental atmosphere for testing

######  Step 3 - Find user participants
- Set up a feedback form
- Word of mouth ask around
- Advertising on Twitter, LinkedIn, or some other social media platform
-  [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) useful tool for scheduling usability testing sessions

###### Step 4 - Run the test!
- After all, the prep is done and users scheduled
- Ask if they are ok with the session being recorded (if you would like that)
- Never forget the point from Csontos 2019 
	- 'Assure your participant that they shoulder no blame. Never let the participants helping you with their valuable feedback feel frustrated '

###### Step 4 - Analyze & Report
- Review your notes and recordings to look for patterns and insights
