How to keep your documentation up to date
#### Learning Objectives 
- How to keep your documentation up to date.
- Implement processes to help keep documentation up to date.
- Identify good practices for documentation maintenance.


###### Goal of Documentation Maintenance
- As the Tool/App is updated so should the documentation


###### Keep Document in a Single Version Control Place
- Version control for Tool/App ie. GitHut
- Documentation could be version controlled similar and maybe in same place
- Easier make it for yourself more likely you will update
- Think about how to make easier on yourself and team for longer term process


###### Tool Fix isn't done before documentation is done
- Track Documentation issues the same way track software task
- Always pair a software fix with a documentation fix (i.e., does this change impact documentation?)
- Good Resource
	-  [issue template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository) (if you use GitHub)  and ensure that the issue template includes a reminder to update documentation.


###### Check For Broken Links
- A common issue with out-of-date documentation is broken Links
- 404 pages bad but when possible add a search feature or link to key areas
- There are GitHub actions and other automation tools that can check the URL

##### Week 5-2 Exercise 1: Add a reminder for documentation updates to your task manager
-   If you use GitHub, add an [issue template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository) that has a reminder to update documentation.   
-   If you use something else for task management, look for some other way to remind yourself (and your fellow developers on the project) to keep documentation up-to-date for each change.

##### Week 5-2 Exercise 2: Implement a URL checker
-   If you use GitHub for your documentation, add a url checking GitHub action to your repository. We used a url-checker GitHub action for developing this course! You can see [ours here for an example](https://github.com/jhudsl/Documentation_and_Usability/blob/main/.github/workflows/url-checker.yml).  
-   If you use something else for version control, look into URL checkers that you can easily implement into your development process.
