###### Cheatsheets
- If Tool/App has items that are handy but tough to keep track of a cheatsheet may be helpful
- Cheatsheets are a short reference guide 1 -2 pages that looks  pleasing

- Good Resources
	- [RStudio’s cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) ([RStudio Team 2020](https://jhudatascience.org/Documentation_and_Usability/no_toc/other-helpful-features.html#ref-RStudioTeam2020)).  
	- Overleaf, there are [template cheatsheets you can use here](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cheat-sheet).


###### Videos
- Useful when Tool/App has a GUI

###### Forums/Knowledge Base
- A good way to keep public records of questions and answers
- Forums are mostly useful for Tools/Apps that grow a big user base, and the team has trouble keeping up with inquires
- Allows advanced users to help answer questions of new users 
- Make this Knowledge Base searchable can reduce the support load of the team
- Can host on your own or use a slack channel or other options
- Good resources
