We can install that using this command: SOME BASH COMMAND TO INSTALL THE DEPENDENCY Now that we have that dependency, we can install {this tool}. We'll need to run this command: SOME BASH COMMAND Run this command and see if it installed correctly. If it did you should see {such and such output -- screenshot might be nice here}. SOME BASH COMMAND TO TEST IF IT INSTALLED If you did not get {such and such} response you may need to {do this other thing}.
